1. Variation and Standard Deviation
    Variance gives how spread-out the data is, it gives average of squared differences from mean
    Standard deviation is root of variance. It is used to find outliers. Dta points that lie outside more than 1sd from mean is unusual.
    Sample variance is divided by N-1 instead of N
    N-1 is used to remove bias, its too biased to the sample

2. Probabilty Density Function and Probability Mass Function
    Distribution of probability of data point falling within a given range e.g. from mean to 1sd is 34%
    For discrete data, we have probability mass Function i.e. probabilities of discrete data, its a histogram

3. Uniform Distribution: equal probabilities of data occuring in any range
   Normal/ Gaussian Distribution: data is centered around the mean
   Binomial Distribution:
    -n trials
    -trials are independent
    -success or ffailure, probability of success same on each trial p
    -total number of success is k
    Its distribution from 0 to n is a binomial distribution
    The shape of distribution depends on n and p, as shown in link https://www.maths.dur.ac.uk/stats/people/jac/singleb/notes2.pdf
   Poisson Distribution:
    -Binomial distribution is about counting success in fixed number of well-defined trials
    -But in science there are open-end counts, unknown number of events
    -Events occur at a rate of lambda
    -Total number of events in time period is s
