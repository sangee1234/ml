NUMERICAL COMPUTATION

Underflow: It is a form of numerical error when numbers near zero is rounded to 0
Overflow: It is a form of numerical error when numbers with large magnitude are approx as infinity or -infinity
In many deep learning algorithms, these errors must be taken into consideration whhile writing functions

Gradient optimization

When f`=0, the derivative provides no information on which direction to more, these are critical or stationary points.
Local minimum is a point where f(x) us lower than all neighboring points
Critical point can be local minimum, local maximum or saddle point, one side up slope and one side down slope
Point having absolute lowest is global minimum.

The gradient df is vecrtor of its first partial derivatives
Hessian d2f is matrix of second partial derivatives
The jacobian of a function n->m, is matrix of first oartial derivatives
The Hessian is jacobian of gradient
